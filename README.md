This github repository holds the pitch for a finalized business idea constructed in a course called Team Science.

The project was completed across four months working within a team of three students, including myself.

Throughout the semester the following actions were done weekly to shape and build the business plan.
- Ask 10 target customers two opinion based questions about the company for improvement
- Attend two lectures given by a professor at UNCC on business experiences and laws in the field of biotechnology
- Present results of customer questioning to the class for advice and discussion

Twice in the semester a pitch was given to mock investors for discussion and evaluation
  - The presentation within this repository was used for those presentations.
